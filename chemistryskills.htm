<p class="titlecase"><u>Practical Skills</u>
<p class="whitecase">Practicals are an essential part of the AQA AS Chemistry course and help to build up specific knowledge which can be assessed in the AS exams. Panning experiments and spotting good and bad elements of shown plans are key skills which you may be asked to demonstrate. On this page, information and details of specific elements of the practicals is provided.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Planning Experiments</p>
<p class="whitecase">Initially, the aim of the experiment is stated, giving the reader information regarding the question the experiment is supposed to answer. Next, a hypothesis is provided which details the events which you expect to observe and may suggest an explantion for such observations. After identifying variables and deciding on what data to collect, appropriate equpment is selected for the experiment. Evaluation and management of risks comes next, before the construction of a detailled method for the experiment. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Keeping control from variables</p>
<p class="whitecase">A variable is a quantity that has the potential to change, and are split into three varieties, independent, dependent and control variables. Independent variables are those which are changed in the experiment, dependent variables are those which are measured in the experiment and control variables are those kept the same. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Selecting Appropriate Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">When conducting an experiment, the equipment has to be suitable. For example, when measuring the amount of gas produced, the equpment should not let any gas escape. The equipment also has to be of the correct size and sensitivity, suitable for the size of the change and the size of the reactiants used. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Different Varieties of Data</p>
<p class="whitecase">There are many different varieties of data and these different classifications sometimes require different forms of processing. Discrete variables can only have certain values on a scale and usually arise from counting, instead of more detailled forms of measurement. A continuous variable, in direct contrast to discrete variables, can have any value on a scale and is not limited to certain values. because of this nature, it is impossible to measure the exact value of a continuous variable as it is often measured in a certain amount of decimal places or significant figures. A categoric variable has values that can be sorted effectively into specific categories, for example colours such as red, blue and green. It is important to remember that these values are often qualitative and often are not quantified. Ordered data is similar to categoric, except that the categories can be put in order, such as slow, medium speed, and fast.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Writing a Method</p>
<p class="whitecase">Methods must be clear and detailled, written in a way that informs someone on how to conduct the experiment and get the same results. A chemistry method must include all the substances and equpment needed, how to control variables, safety precautions to undertake, and what data to collect and how to conduct the act of data collection.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Experimental Errors and Uncertainty</p>
<p class="whitecase">In order to reduce the impacts of experimental error in results, certain measures can be taken. One of which could be to repeat the experiment a number of times, record the values, and calculate the average (mean) value. Usually, conducting the experiment 3 times will suffice, repeating it any more times may be too arduous. The percentage uncertainty is calculated by undertainty/reading x 100, and can me minimised by using more sensitive equipment, for example, a ruler with a finer scale. Also, the larger the reading, the smaller the percentage uncertainty, so using larger amounts may be more accurate (for example using a larger mass on a mass balance).
<p class="subtitlecase">Presenting and Processing Data</p>
<p class="whitecase">Results are often organised in a table, which provides clear columns where experimental data can be easily written against the independent variable which has been changed. In tables, calculated data, such as the mean, can be displayed within the table in another column. As well as a table, at the end of an investigation, a scatter graph can be useful as a means to show how two sets of continuous data are related. A line of best fit, straight or curved can show the trend and may be useful to predict certain values of variables within the data range but not recorded. Bar charts are useful for categoric or ordered data. When drawing graphs, a title needs to be given, a sensible scale needs to be used, axes need labeling, and points need to be plotted accurately in order to ensure that full marks are gained. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Anomalous Results</p>
<p class="whitecase">Anomalous results do not conform with the trend shown by the other values, more likely than not, they are incorrect and are often caused by mistakes or problems with the apparatus. These results should be ignored when conducting further calculations</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Making Conclusions</p>
<p class="whitecase">In an experiment, a conclusion must be only based on the observations and the calculated data produced from an experiment. Any conclusion cannot discount the possibility that the change may not directly be a result of changes in the independent variable. This is because it is often difficult to keep other variables constant, minute changes in temperature may occur throughout the experiment, which may influence the results. Conclusions also need to be specific, and cannot generalise across a wider range than was used in the experiment. Results should be valid (answer the original question), accurate (close to the true value), precise, (smaller spread from the mean), and reproducable (same results are gained when the experiment is repeated). </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Comparison to the Results of Peers</p>
<p class="whitecase">It may be useful to discuss how your results compared to that of the peers and therefore determine if your results are reproducible. Comparison witht the results of others may highlight errors with the experiment and may add further insights or reasoning to the results and observations produced.</p>
