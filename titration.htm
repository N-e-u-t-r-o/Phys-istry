<p class="titlecase"><u>Making a Standard Solution and Carrying Out a Simple Titration</u>
<p class="whitecase">Standard Solutions are used by scientists to help determine unknown quantities and are used as references for comparison. In this process, you will make a standard solution of known concentration. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Making a Standard Solution - Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-10cm^3 Pipette, -Pipette filler, -Distilled water, -Funnel, -250cm^3 Volumetric Flask, -Stopper, -Scales, -Sodium Chloride, -Beaker, -Stirring Rod.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Making a Standard Soluton - Method</p>
<p class="whitecase">1. First weigh a dry weighing boat, noting down the exact mass of it.</br>
<p class="whitecase">2. Place the weighing boat on the scales and, using a spatula, weigh out between 1.00g and 1.50g of Sodium Chloride, note the exact mass.</br>
<p class="whitecase">3. Pour the contents of the weighing boat into a beaker and re-weigh the weighing bottle (it may contain some traces of Sodium Chloride).</br>
<p class="whitecase">4. Calculate the mass of Sodium Chloride transferred.</br>
<p class="whitecase">5. Add a small amount of water to the beaker and use the stirring rod to dissolve all of the solid.</br>
<p class="whitecase">6. Using a funnel, pour the contents of the beaker into the 250cm^3 volumetric flask and rinse the stirring rod, funnel and beaker with water into the volumetric flask.</br>
<p class="whitecase">7. Add more water to the solution until it is at 250cm^3. Be careful not to allow the solution to go over 250cm^3, if it does you may have to make it again.</br>
<p class="whitecase">8. Stopper the flask and thoroughly mix the contents, invering it at least 3 times.</br>
<p class="whitecase">9. Calculate the exact concentration using n=cv/1000 (where n is moles in mol, c is concentration in mol/dm^3 and v is volume in dm^3). Quote the value to an appropriate precision.</p>
<p class="whitecase">Sodium Hydroxide can be neutralised by most acids and in this case, Hydrochloric Acid will be used. These chemicals react in a 1 to 1 ratio, shown in the equation; NaOH + HCl -> NaCl + H2O. In this practical, Sodium Hydroxide will be titrated with 0.5 moldm^-3 Hydrochloric Acid. The indicator used will be phenol pthalein with is pink in alkali and colourless in acid.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Conducing a Titration - Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-Burete, -250cm^3 Conical flask, -25cm^3 pipette, Pipette filler, -Phenol pthalein, -Sodium Hydroxide, -0.5moldm^-3 Hydrochloric acid, -Distilled water, -Funnel
<p class="subtitlecase">Conducting a Titration - Method</p>
<p class="whitecase">1. First set up the burette on a clamp stand with a burette holder</br>
<p class="whitecase">2. Place a white tile at the base of the clamp stand</br>
<p class="whitecase">3. Pipette 25cm^3 of Sodium Hydroxide into the 250cm^3 conical flask (ensuring that the flask has been rinsed with deionised water).</br>
<p class="whitecase">4. Add a few drops of indicator to the solution in the conical flask.</br>
<p class="whitecase">5. Rinse the burette with water before preparing it by filling it with acid. Record the initial burette reading, to an appropriate level of significant figures.</br>
<p class="whitecase">6. Titrate the contents of the conical flask by adding Hydrochloric Acid to it from the burette. Add the Hydrochloric Acid solution slowly, swirling the flask gently to mix the solution. Add the acid dropwise near the end-point until the indicator undergoes a definite colour change; this is the end-point of the titration. Record the final burette reading in your table of results.</br>
<p class="whitecase">7. Repeat the titration until two concordant results are received (two results within 0.1cm^3 of each other). Remember to record all the results that are obtained.</br>
<p class="whitecase">8. Calculate the mean titre to 1 decimal place using only the concordant results.</br>
<p class="whitecase">9. From this, the concentration of sodium hydroxide can be calculated.</br>
