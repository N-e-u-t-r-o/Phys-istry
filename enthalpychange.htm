<p class="titlecase"><u>Determination of an enthalpy change which cannot be measured directly</u>
<p class="whitecase">This experiment involves the measuring of two enthalpies of a reaction and the use of a hess cycle to find the unknown enthalpy. The overall enthalpy to find will be the enthalpy of reaction from anhydrous copper sulfate to hydrated copper sulfate. The reaction between hydrated copper sulfate to copper sulfate solution and the reaction from anhydrous copper sulfate to copper sulfate solution will be conducted in the experiment. By applying Hess's law, the unknown enthalpy change can be discovered. </p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-Hydrated copper sulfate crystals (small), -Anhydrous copper sulfate powder, -Polystyrene cup (acts as a calorimeter), 250cm^3 beaker, -Stand and clamp, -Glass or digital thermometer (0 to 50 degrees), -Two 25cm^3 measuring cylinders, -Two weighing boats, -Stopwatch/stopclock, -Graph paper, -Stirrer, -Deionised or distilled water, -Digital scales.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Method - Experiment 1 (anhydrous copper sulfate to copper sulfate solution)</p>
<p class="whitecase">1. Weigh out between 3.9 and 4.1 g of anhydrous copper sulfate into a dry weighing boat (taking care to avoid skin contact). The precise mass should be recorded.</br>
<p class="whitecase">2. Construct a table of results allowing temperatures to be recorded up to 15 minutes (with 1 minute intervals).</br>
<p class="whitecase">3. Place 25cm^3 of deionised water into a polystyrene cup using a measuring cylider and record the temperature at the beginning (t=0), start the timer and record the temperature every minute, while stirring the liquid.</br>
<p class="whitecase">4. After four minutes have elapsed, add the anhydrous copper sulfate rapidly to the water in the cup and continue to stir (do not record the temperature for t=4). For the other minutes, record the temperature of the solution.</br>
<p class="whitecase">5. Plot a graph of temperature against time, draw lines of best fit before and after the addition of anhydrous copper sulfate.</p>

<p class="subtitlecase">Method - Experiment 2 (hydrated copper sulfate to copper sulfate solution).</p>
<p class="whitecase">1. Weigh out between 6.2g and 6.3 f of hydrated copper sulfate in a dry stoppered weighing boat, record the precise mass. </br>
<p class="whitecase">2. Construct a suitable table of results with the same scale as the first experiment</br>
<p class="whitecase">3. Using the measuring sylinder, place 24cm^3 of deionised water into a polystyrene cup.</br>
<p class="whitecase">4. Repeat the process in experiment 1, with the copper sulfate crystals added at the fourth minute, and the temperature recorded for fifteen minutes.</br>
<p class="whitecase">5. Plot the graph and determine the temperature change (as in experiment 1).</br>
<p class="whitecase">6. Construct a hess cycle and subtract the value found in experiment 2 from that of experiment 1 to find the desired enthalpy change.</br>
