<p class="titlecase"><u>How the rate of reaction of Sodium Thiosulfate and Hydrochloric Acid changes with temperature</u>
<p class="whitecase">The reaction between Sodium Thiosulfate and Hydrochloric Acid produces a precipitate of sulfur. The rate of reaction can be monitored by timing how long it takes for a fixed amount of sulfur to be produces. This can be achieved by marking a cross on a white tile at the bottom of the reaction vessel and measuring the time taken for it to disappear as it is obscured by sulfur precipitate. The hydrochloric acid will be added to sodium thiosulfate at different temperatures.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Equipment</p>
<p class="whitecase">-40gdm^-3 Sodium Thipsulfate, -1moldm^-3 Hydrochloric Acid, -10cm^3 Measuring cylinder, -250cm^3 Conical flask, -250cm^3 Beaker, -Funnel, -2 Thermometers, -Stopwatch, -Kettle, -Ice, -Tubs to act as water baths (hold a conical flask and beaker at the same time), -White tile with a black cross drawn by permanent pen, -2 Plastic graduated pipettes.</p>
<p class="subtitlecase">Method</p>
<p class="whitecase">1. Measure out 50cm^3 of Sodium Thiosulfate into a measuring cylinder using the plastic pipette. After this, transfer the solution to the conical flask.</br>
<p class="whitecase">2. Use the plastic pipette to measure 10cm^3 of Hydrochloric acid into a measuring cylinder, transfer this to the glass beaker. This establishes a 5 to 1 ratio of Sodium Thiosulfate to Hydrochloric acid.</br>
<p class="whitecase">3. Construct a table of temperatures 10 to 50 degrees.
<p class="whitecase">4. Depending on the desired temperature, place both the flask and the beaker into a water bath with water (heated by the kettle) or ice. Add thermometers to the beaker and flask to moniter the temperatures</br>
<p class="whitecase">5. When the beaker and flask have reached the desired temperature, rapidly remove the flask and beaker from the water bath and place the flask on the white tile.</br>
<p class="whitecase">6. Start the stopwatch immediately as the contents of the beaker are added to the conical flask, this will commence the reaction.</br>
<p class="whitecase">7. Wait for the black cross to disappear, looking directly at the flask throughout, and stop the stopwatch when the cross is no longer visible, the time for this is recorded. </br>
<p class="whitecase">7. The process can be repeated a number of times to create an average which should make the improve the final results as the experiment is inherently relatively inaccurate (there may be different perceptions of when the cross disappears for each temperature).</br>
